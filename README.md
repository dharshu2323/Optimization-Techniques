# GRADIENT DESCENT:
  
   ðŸ‘‰It is the iterative optimization algorithm used in machine learning to train models.
   
   
   ðŸ‘‰It is also used to train neural networks
   
   
   ðŸ‘‰It helps in finding the local minimum of a function.

 # ADAPTIVE GRADIENT DESCENT:
    ðŸ‘‰In this algorithm adapts learning rates for each parameter individually and incorporates exponential moving averages of gradients 
      and squared gradients.
